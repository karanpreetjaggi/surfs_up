# SURFS UP
## Overview
The purpose of the project was to get more information before opening the surf shops especially in month of June and December to make sure that the surf and ice cream business is sustainable all year around in Oahu.
## Results
Looking at the data, month of June has average higher temperature of 74 vs 71 in month of December. Also, June has the highest temperature of 85 and lowest temperature of 60 vs Decemeber, which has the highest temperature of 83 and lowest is 56. 
## Summary
The max temperatures are comparable but min temperatures have a difference of 4 degree which can turn into pretty cold weather in winter. I think we should add stations to see the temperature variance for various stations and pick the best site with highest min, max and average temp.
